# digitalEnvelopeSim
I need a lot more practice at repository management and such and I also want to work on my portfoio,
so I am trying to finish a project that I started last semester, but nver got the code working 
as well as I would have liked.  Its a simulation of the way a digital envelope would work in an
encryption / decryption scheme.  Everything mostly works, I am just not getting the correct hash values.
Thanks ahead of time for any interest anyone might show.  I know it needs a lot of cleaning up!
